The Atlanta Police Department (APD) is a law enforcement agency in the city of Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. The city shifted from its rural-based Marshal and Deputy Marshal model at the end of the 19th century. In 1873, the department was formed with 26 officers. Thomas Jones was elected the first Atlanta Chief of Police by the city council. The agency is located at: 226 Peachtree St SW, Atlanta, Ga. 30303. The 1,700+ officer force is currently being led by former Assistant Police Chief Rodney Bryant (acting), after Chief Erika Shields resigned following the killing of Rayshard Brooks. Bryant will serve as interim police chief until the city finds a replacement. The Atlanta Police Department works with the City of Atlanta Corrections Department, which operates three jails: City Detention Center, Grady Detention Center, Court Detention Center. In the City of Atlanta, there are six "patrol zones" (more commonly known as just "zones") which lie under the jurisdiction of the Field Operations Division of the Atlanta Police Department.

The Zone 3 area is located on the south/southeast and parts of southwest side of the city. The Zone 4 area is located on the southwest side of Atlanta.
